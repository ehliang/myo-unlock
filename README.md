# myo-unlock
An application in python for the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs. Built at Tech Retreat 2015, this app asks the user to define a set of gesture inputs (fist, wavein, waveout, doubletap, spread) and use these as a password to unlock accounts. <br/>
NOTE: Needs the Myo-SDK installed to run. 
<br/>
Currently capable of unlocking a gmail account but can be further developed to include social media and computer user accounts.
